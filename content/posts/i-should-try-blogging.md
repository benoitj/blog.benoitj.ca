Like many, I've been thinking about sharing using a personal blog. Like many, I've been procrastinating about it :).

I can thank the movement #100DaysToOffload initiated by Kev Quirk on fosstodon to get me out of my lazyness.

Im hoping to share whatever interest me, but mostly:

-   coding
-   linux, apps I use
-   electronics and games
-   anything I am learning right now, from food, to building house stuff

I intent to post twice a week. We'll see how long I can keep the blogging procrastination beast away :)

As a constant learner, constructive feedbacks are always welcomed. See my [about](/about) page for contact info.

_This is Day 1 of my #100DaysToOffload_
