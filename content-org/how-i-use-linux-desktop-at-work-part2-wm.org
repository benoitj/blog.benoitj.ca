Part 2 of the series /How I use Linux desktop at work/

Just to recap, this series is describing how I leverage vagrant and virtualbox to provision development VM on my work PCs. I'm also taking the opportunity to build them from scratch with the tools I use at home.

In the post, we go over:
1. creating a basic arch VM
2. configure memory/cpu and disk allocation
3. install X related packages
4. Install one Window Manager (TBD: Mate?, xfce?, Cinnamon? )

- [ ] unordered list item 1
-

  list item with empty first and second line \\
  normally an empty line breaks the list item - but we make an exception for the first line and don't count it towards that limit
- unordered list item 2 - with ~inline~ /markup/

     a) [X] ordered sublist item 1
