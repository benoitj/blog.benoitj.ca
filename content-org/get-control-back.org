One thing that strikes me over all these years, is that we never tell Managers not to use Excel, we never tell mechanics not to use a certain rench, but we get told by IT and management which tools not to use. There are reasons for this, but I think it's time for the coders community to step up and get back the control over their tools.

I've been working hard at my current employer and collaborating with our IT department to get Linux laptops. I've had some success and this will be the topic of a future post.

For the time being, this post is about how I manage to run all the tooling I want to use on my Windows OS.
